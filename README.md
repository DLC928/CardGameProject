# Tactical Card Game Inspired By Duelyst

## Description
This project is an online tactical card game designed as part of a University of Glasgow assignment. The game combines card-play mechanics with a chess-like board. This project was developed alongside three other team members, where we worked to create the core back-end service in Java that manages and progresses the game as the player takes actions in a web browser. The final product enables a human player to complete a game with a (semi-)intelligent AI opponent.
